# Air Passengers Time Series Forecasting

Forecast monthly air passenger numbers using time series analysis and machine learning models. This project applies techniques like ARIMA and LSTM to predict future passenger trends, helping airlines optimize operations and plan for demand fluctuations.

##  Project Overview

This repository demonstrates how to analyze and forecast air passenger traffic using historical data. Key steps include:

- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) of passenger trends
- Time series decomposition and visualization
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Implementation of forecasting models like ARIMA and LSTM
- Evaluation and comparison of model performance

##  Dataset

The dataset contains monthly total numbers of international airline passengers from 1949 to 1960.
